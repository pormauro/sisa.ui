# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Sync Batch API

The `/sync/batch` endpoint responds with a structure that now includes a mapping of
local operation identifiers to their server-assigned IDs:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "batch_id": "example-batch-id",
  "results": [],
  "map": {
    "local_to_remote": {
      "1": 42
    }
  },
  "history": {
    "max_history_id": 0,
    "changes": []
  }
}
```

The `map.local_to_remote` object helps clients reconcile temporary `local_id`
values with the corresponding remote identifiers returned by the server.
